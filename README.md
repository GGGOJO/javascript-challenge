Create a dynamic table for users to interact with alien sighting data.

<b>Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search</b><br>
I created a HTML page to import a sample, fictious (?) UFO dataset, which was in the form of an array of JavaScripts objects.
In the app.js file, I wrote code that appends the data into a html table and adds rows of data for each UFO sighting. 
I used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date column to find rows that match user's input.

<b>Level 2: Multiple Search Categories</b><br>
Expanding on level 1's code, I created a multiple inputs to filtered the data on:
<ul> <li> Date </li>
<li> City </li>
<li> State </li>
<li> Country </li>
<li> Shape </li></ul>
The main table would then reload a new filtered table based on the user's input.
